# Best Paper Awards

Since all the accepted papers had a junior researcher as the main author,
there was not an explicit separate junior best paper cathegory.
At the same time the program comittee identified two (and not just one)
very strong papers and could not decide among them. For these reasons
FroCoS 2023 awarded two papers the joint best paper award. Namely:

* "Weighted Path Orders are Semantic Path Orders" by Teppei Saito and Nao Hirokawa, and
* "Recurrence-Driven Summations in Automated Deduction" by Visa Nummelin, Jasmin Blanchette and Sander R. Dahmen.

Congratulations again to the winners.
