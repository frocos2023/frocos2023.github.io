# The 14th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems

## Welcome to FroCoS 2023

FroCoS 2023 will take place at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics (CIIRC) of the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU), Czech Republic
on September 20-22, 2023.

The conference is the 14th in a series of meetings of the International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS).

FroCoS 2023 will be colocated with the 32nd International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods <a href="https://tableaux2023.github.io/">TABLEAUX 2023</a>.

## Aims

[FroCoS](http://frocos.cs.uiowa.edu/) is the main international event for research on the development of techniques and methods for the combination and integration of formal systems, their modularization and analysis. The first FroCoS symposium was held in Munich, Germany, in 1996. Initially held every two years, since 2004 it has been organized annually with alternate years forming part of IJCAR.

FroCoS 2023 will be co-located with the 32nd International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2023).

The FroCoS 2023 conference proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS).

## Scope
In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation, program development and verification, artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general purpose systems. This has led to the development of techniques and methods for the combination and integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their modularization and analysis.

The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS) traditionally focuses on these types of research questions and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2023 seeks to offer a common forum for research in the general area of combination, modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on logic-based methods and their practical use.

## List of topics

Topics of interest for FroCoS 2023 include (but are not restricted to):

Combinations of
- logics such as higher-order, first-order, temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics
- logics with probability and/or fuzzy measures
- reasoning procedures, SAT solvers, constraint solving techniques, logical frameworks, deduction methods, and constraint propagation
- logics for distributed and multi-agent systems
- term rewriting systems
- logical reasoning with machine learning
- logics, reasoning, and natural language processing/semantics
- programs and specifications and their logical aspects, incl. modularisation

Integration of
- equational and other theories into deductive systems, incl. SMT
- data structures into constraint logic programming and deduction

Modularity
- of/in logics
- in term rewriting

and the application of any of these, for example for knowledge representation, ontology engineering, and the verification or analysis of information systems.
