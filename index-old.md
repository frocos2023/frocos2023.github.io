# The 14th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems

## Welcome to FroCoS 2023

FroCoS 2023 will take place at the Computer Science Department of the Birmingham University, United Kingdom on September 8-10, 2021.

The conference is the 13th in a series of meetings of the International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS).

FroCoS 2021 will be colocated with the 28th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods [TABLEAUX 2021](https://www.tableaux2021.org).

## Registration
TABLEAUX and FroCoS will be entirely free-of-charge to attend, but registration is mandatory to fully engage with the scientific program. We may choose to also stream talks publicly (with no need for registration), but this will be confirmed at a later date.

The registration form is [here](https://forms.gle/DRNBgeRKA4Qbcsws7).

If you wish to attend physically, you should indicate it and submit your registration form by **13 August** at the latest. Note that you are able to edit this response in case of change of circumstances. Depending on the level of interest, we may ask for more information or confirmation of physical attendance at a later point. More information about the conference format will be updated on this page.

## Aims

[FroCoS](http://frocos.cs.uiowa.edu/) is the main international event for research on the development of techniques and methods for the combination and integration of formal systems, their modularization and analysis. The first FroCoS symposium was held in Munich, Germany, in 1996. Initially held every two years, since 2004 it has been organized annually with alternate years forming part of IJCAR.

FroCoS 2021 will be co-located with the 29th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2021).

The FroCoS 2021 conference proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS).

## Scope
In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation, program development and verification, artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general purpose systems. This has led to the development of techniques and methods for the combination and integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their modularization and analysis.

The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS) traditionally focuses on these types of research questions and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2021 seeks to offer a common forum for research in the general area of combination, modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on logic-based methods and their practical use.

## List of topics
Topics of interest for FroCoS 2021 include (but are not restricted to):

- combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order, temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics)
- combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving
- combination of decision procedures, satisfiability procedures, constraint solving techniques, or logical frameworks
- combination of logics with probability and/or fuzzy measures
- combinations and modularity in ontologies
- integration of equational and other theories into deductive systems
- hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint propagation
- hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural language semantics
- combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems
- logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and specifications
- integration of data structures into constraint logic programming and deduction
- combinations and modularity in term rewriting
- methods and techniques for the verification and analysis of information systems
- methods and techniques for combining logical reasoning with machine learning

## Covid

TABLEAUX 2021 and FroCoS 2021 are intended to be hybrid conferences welcoming both physical and virtual participation. The organisers are closely monitoring the pandemic situation and may choose to make the conference virtual-only if it seems unreasonable to host any sort of physical event. A final decision will be taken before 14 June (12 weeks before the conference) to leave ample time for potential travel plans to be made.
